Relative functions test

database script:
mat_test_relative_functions.sql

test xml:


database script steps (can be done manually):
1) create measure populating the following measure phrases where P#(*) denotes a phrase and Q# dnotes a QDS element:
2) P1 = RELATIVEFIRST(Q1)
3) P2 = (P1 EAS Q2)
4) P3 = (P1 EAS < 3 weeks Q2)
5) P4 = RELATIVESECOND(Q3 SBOD Q4)
6) P5 = RELATIVESECOND(Q3 SBOD >= 4 hours Q4)
7) P6 = RELATIVESECOND(Q5 EBS P2)
8) P7 = RELATIVEFIRST(Q6)
9) P8 = Q6 SBS P7

10) assign AND --> P1, P3 to population system clause
11) assign AND --> P4, P5 to numerator system clause
12) assign AND --> P6 to denominator system clause
13) ssign AND --> P8 to exceptions system clause

14) enter measure details
15) create a grouping and measure package with population, numerator, denominator, and exceptions
16) export the measure and verify:
	POP: has 2 Left hand side IMMEDIATE PRIOR entries
	NUM: has 2 CURRENT left hand side entries
	DENOM: has a CURRENT left hand side entry and a nested IMMEDIATE PRIOR left hand side entry
	EXCL: has a right hand side IMMEDIATE PRIOR entry

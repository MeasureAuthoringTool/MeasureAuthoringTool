Defect 343 Test

database script: 
mat_defect_343.sql

database script steps (can be done manually):
01) create eMeasure 
02) create 2 system clauses sc1 and sc2 for each category of system clause (populaiton, numerator, denominator, exclusions, exceptions)
03) create 2 phrases p1 and p2 for each category of system clause.
04) for each sc1 add AND --> p1
05) for each sc2 add AND --> p2
test steps:
06) for each system clause category verify you can select both sc1 and sc2 
07) navigate away to save 
08) sign out 
09) sign in and navigate to clause workspace 
10) for each system clause category verify you can select both sc1 and sc2 

Notes: setClauseToDiagram(...) now invokes addDiagramObject(...) with a Criterion argument not CriterionPatrent, Criterion constructor added to acommodate
Need to test creation of >= 10 system clauses for a single category
